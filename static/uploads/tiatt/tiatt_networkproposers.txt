Informal guidelines to bring more people

If your name is not here, it means either you have not accepted the official invitation from COST or we haven't updated the list. If it is the former case, you should have received an email from the COST portal. We can send a new one, if you need it. Accepting the formal invitation is not just about clicking on a button. It might take you some minutes to fill forms and upload your CV.

== Informal guidelines to bring more people ==

1. What kind of person are we targetting? Obviously, we want good researchers. They should work on something related to information systems (all languages, and modalities are welcome; multi-* too).

1.a So far we have computer scientists (from different subdisciplines), linguists, philosophers. We are looking for a diverse group of people that can actually produce interesting discussions that would not be possible with one single profile/background. 

1.b Think of people who are proactive. People that are not shy at identifying issues/open problems, but who do not stop there: they are willing to find solutions, together.

1.c COST actions are about interacting with people, about building networks and gathering often, both online and IRL. Therefore, think of people you appreciate/respect/trust as a researcher, people that are team workers, and (ideally) that you enjoy hanging out with.

2. At least 50% of the countries must be ITC. So far we have 5 (first section of this document). The ITC countries are 

Albania, Armenia, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Türkiye, Ukraine

As of now (17/10/24), we have room to add one non-ITC country. We are in contact with colleagues from Germany. 

3. Other than geography, two other diversity factors COST actions pay particular attention to are gender and young researchers (under 40). So far (as of 17/10/24), we are doing fairly well in this front...

3.a We have 39% women 

3.b We have 22% young researchers

4. Companies are welcome. So far we only have one.

5. Do you want to propose somebody? You are more than welcome. Please, consider the following: 

5.a If you want to propose a person from a country already participating (ITC or not), please let us know.

5.b If you want to propose a person from a new non-ITC, please consider that we might not be able to include her/him, unless we have an extra ITC. We can keep that person in a waiting list, hoping to make room.

5.c If you want to propose a person from a new ITC, please let us know ASAP. Such new ITC could open the door to invite even more people. We are in contact with some colleagues from Lithuania, but we do not have confirmation yet.
 
6. Do you have somebody in mind but you don't think that person would be willing to join in such a short notice or you are not 100% sure? Don't panic, don't rush it. Would the action get accepted, we are going to be allowed to add new people later on.
