abstract: Propagandistic online content could be everywhere; e.g., social  media,
  web forums, and news articles. Nonetheless, the vast majority of  efforts to build
  computational models to automatically detect propaganda has  been centered on news
  outlets, given that historically this space is where  people used to attend to get
  informed. This has gradually changed. Today the  Internet, and in particular some
  social media have become the main news and  event spreaders worldwide. In this study,
  we explore the detection of  propaganda in tweets. The originality of our contribution
  resides in the  creation of PropitterX, a Twitter-based dataset that we extend by  incorporating
  contextual information for each instance, thus allowing for the  study not only
  of the contents within a tweet but also of the roles of  different aspects, such
  as the political bias behind the post, its  publication time, region of origin,
  and even its predominant emotion evoked.  We present this corpus alongside four
  data sub-collections to show how  different questions about propaganda detection
  could be posed to take  advantage of this resource and further advance in this task.
