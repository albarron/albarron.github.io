abstract: We propose misogyny detection as an Argumentative Reasoning task and we
  investigate the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to understand the implicit
  reasoning used to convey misogyny in both Italian and English. The central aim is
  to generate the missing reasoning link between a message and the implied meanings
  encoding the misogyny. Our study uses argumentation theory as a foundation to form
  a collection of prompts in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. These prompts integrate
  different techniques, including chain-of-thought reasoning and augmented knowledge.
  Our findings show that LLMs fall short on reasoning capabilities about misogynistic
  comments and that they mostly rely on their implicit knowledge derived from internalized
  common stereotypes about women to generate implied assumptions, rather than on inductive
  reasoning.
