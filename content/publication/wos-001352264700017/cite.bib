 abstract = {We present an overview of the third edition of the CheckThat! Lab 
at CLEF 2020. The lab featured five tasks in two different languages:
English and Arabic. The first four tasks compose the full pipeline of
claim verification in social media: Task 1 on check-worthiness
estimation, Task 2 on retrieving previously fact-checked claims, Task 3
on evidence retrieval, and Task 4 on claim verification. The lab is
completed with Task 5 on check-worthiness estimation in political
debates and speeches. A total of 67 teams registered to participate in
the lab (up from 47 at CLEF 2019), and 23 of them actually submitted
runs (compared to 14 at CLEF 2019). Most teams used deep neural networks
based on BERT, LSTMs, or CNNs, and achieved sizable improvements over
the baselines on all tasks. Here we describe the tasks setup, the
evaluation results, and a summary of the approaches used by the
participants, and we discuss some lessons learned. Last but not least,
we release to the research community all datasets from the lab as well
as the evaluation scripts, which should enable further research in the
important tasks of check-worthiness estimation and automatic claim
verification.},
