abstract: 'We present our submission to SemEval 2022 Task 5 on Multimedia  Automatic
  Misogyny Identification. We address the two tasks: Task A consists of  identifying
  whether a meme is misogynous. If so, Task B attempts to identify its  kind among
  shaming, stereotyping, objectification, and violence. Our approach  combines a BERT
  Transformer with CLIP for the textual and visual  representations. Both textual
  and visual encoders are fused in an early-fusion  fashion through a Multimodal Bidirectional
  Transformer with unimodally  pretrained components. Our official submissions obtain
  macro-averaged  F$_1$=0.727 in Task A (4th position out of 69 participants)and weighted  F$_1$=0.710
  in Task B (4th position out of 42 participants).'
