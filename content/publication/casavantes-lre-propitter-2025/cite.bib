 abstract = {Propagandistic online content could be everywhere; e.g., social 
media, web forums, and news articles. Nonetheless, the vast majority of 
efforts to build computational models to automatically detect propaganda has 
been centered on news outlets, given that historically this space is where 
people used to attend to get informed. This has gradually changed. Today the 
Internet, and in particular some social media have become the main news and 
event spreaders worldwide. In this study, we explore the detection of 
propaganda in tweets. The originality of our contribution resides in the 
creation of PropitterX, a Twitter-based dataset that we extend by 
incorporating contextual information for each instance, thus allowing for the 
study not only of the contents within a tweet but also of the roles of 
different aspects, such as the political bias behind the post, its 
publication time, region of origin, and even its predominant emotion evoked. 
We present this corpus alongside four data sub-collections to show how 
different questions about propaganda detection could be posed to take 
advantage of this resource and further advance in this task.},
