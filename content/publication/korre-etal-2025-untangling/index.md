abstract: 'Hate speech relies heavily on cultural influences, leading to varying individual
  interpretations. For that reason, we propose a Semantic Componential Analysis (SCA)
  framework for a cross-cultural and cross-domain analysis of hate speech definitions.
  We create the first dataset of hate speech definitions encompassing 493 definitions
  from more than 100 cultures, drawn from five key domains: online dictionaries, academic
  research, Wikipedia, legal texts, and online platforms. By decomposing these definitions
  into semantic components,our analysis reveals significant variation across definitions,
  yet many domains borrow definitions from one another without taking into account
  the target culture. We conduct zero-shot model experiments using our proposed dataset,
  employing three popular open-sourced LLMs to understand the impact of different
  definitions on hate speech detection. Our findings indicate that LLMs are sensitive
  to definitions: responses for hate speech detection change according to the complexity
  of definitions used in the prompt.'
