## Overview

Research on knowledge graph construction (KGC) has recently shown great promise also thanks to the adoption of large language models (LLM) for the automatic extraction of structured information from raw text. However, most works rely on commercial, closed-source LLMs, hindering reproducibility and accessibility. We explore KGC with smaller, open-weight LLMs and investigate whether they can be used to improve upon the results obtained by systems leveraging bigger, closed-source models. Specifically, we focus on CodeKGC, a prompting framework based on GPT-3.5. We choose a variety of models either pre-trained primarily on natural language or on code and fine-tune them on three datasets used for information extraction.
