 abstract = {We present our submission to SemEval 2022 Task 5 on Multimedia 
Automatic Misogyny Identification. We address the two tasks: Task A consists of 
identifying whether a meme is misogynous. If so, Task B attempts to identify its 
kind among shaming, stereotyping, objectification, and violence. Our approach 
combines a BERT Transformer with CLIP for the textual and visual 
representations. Both textual and visual encoders are fused in an early-fusion 
fashion through a Multimodal Bidirectional Transformer with unimodally 
pretrained components. Our official submissions obtain macro-averaged 
F$_1$=0.727 in Task A (4th position out of 69 participants)and weighted 
F$_1$=0.710 in Task B (4th position out of 42 participants).},
