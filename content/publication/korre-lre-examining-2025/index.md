abstract: This study examines whether the psycholinguistic and demographic  characteristics
  of authors of online texts are correlated with the way  harmful language, such as
  toxicity and hate speech, is judged. We apply  artificial intelligence models to
  two harmful language datasets, Jigsaw’s  Special Rater Pool dataset and the Measuring
  Hate Speech dataset, to generate  probabilities for different text aspects, namely
  inferring demographic  information of the author behind the suspicious text in terms
  of age and  gender, as well as the expressed emotions, emotionality, sentiment and  communication
  style. We then perform a statistical regression analysis to  examine how these text
  aspects correlate with the perception of hate speech  and toxicity during the annotation
  process. The study shows that while the  frequency of the psycholinguistic text
  aspects that can be derived from the  author’s personality does not differ significantly
  between harmful and  non-harmful classes, the inferred text aspects are statistically
  associated  with the annotators’ perception of harmful language and could potentially  influence
  the way annotators label the texts.
